			<h1>Projects</h1>
			<p>
				This is a small collection of some random projects I've done over the years. They're all
				open source, so feel free to use them. I hope to add more as I dig them out of archives.
			</p>
			<h2><a href="https://gitorious.org/getreel">Getreel</a></h2>
			<p>
				A web service for people with data caps. This service allows you to add
				videos to be downloaded at a schedule time, and played as files or via
				servers like <a
				href="http://www.jezra.net/projects/muttonchop">MuttonChop</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I created the responsive GUI for Getreel.
			</p>
			<h2><a href="https://gitorious.org/dynmap-chat">jQuery DynMap Chat Widget</a></h2>
			<p>
				I play a lot of <a href="http://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>, and help run a server or two.
				So that we could display the server chat on our website, I whipped up a little chunk of
				jQuery that would pull the chat text from the DynMap plugin.
			</p>
			<h2><a href="https://gitorious.org/barcamp-badge-creator">BarCamp Badge Creator</a></h2>
			<p>
				I was lucky enough to attend the first and second <a href="http://oggcamp.org/">OggCamp</a>
				un-conferences, and was able to meet quite a few people I had gotten to know online. There
				was just one problem... how do you identify someone you've known only via forum avatars?
			</p>
			<p>
				A quick coding sprint later, I had a small PHP script that would generate you a "Hello,
				My Name Is" image that you could print out and stick on your shirt/laptop/etc.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<a href="https://gitorious.org/florrie-comic-management-system">Florrie: Comic Management
				System</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				This is a refactored, incomplete version of a PHP4 Comic management system I created for 
				some friends that run the <a href="http://valcielle.fragdev.com">Val'Cielle</a> web comic.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've put this project on hold mostly, due to the comic also being put on hold. I'm planning
				on finishing this at some point, possibly in Django.
			</p>
			<h2><a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org">Hacker Public Radio</a></h2>
			<p>
				As someone who enjoys the akward, knobly bits of technology and the stranger, more obscure
				aspects of DIY, I'm an avid listener and occasional contributer to the <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org">Hacker Public Radio</a>
				network. Feel free to check out some of my contributions, and more importantly, make some of
				your own. Hacker Public Radio is always looking for new hosts!
			</p>
			<h2><a href="https://gitorious.org/silly-mpd-script">Silly MPD Script</a></h2>
			<p>
				While on the quest for the perfect media player (still unfinished, I'm afraid) I created
				a small bash script that would control MPD. I then bound these functions to the audio keys
				in my OpenBox config, so that I could switch songs, pause playback, and more with a single
				keystroke.

			<h1>Social Coding</h1>
			<p>
				A good majority of the coding I do is in public. You can check me out (no version control
				pun intended, honest) on <a href="https://gitorious.org/~windigo">Gitorious</a>, or follow me
				on <a href="https://github.com/lo-windigo">GitHub</a> where I'll try to mirror my
				repositories for those who prefer that service.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to the projects I have listed here, I have several config files for programs I
				use. I hope someone finds them useful!

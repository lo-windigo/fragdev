		<h2>Fragmented Development</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Fragmented Development</strong> was originally started as a Web Design company,
			going by the name of Wednesday Bubbles. While mildly successful in it's
			own small way, WB had several problems; first, the general public cannot
			spell Wednesday. Also, it's very hard to gain respect with a name that
			includes the word "Bubbles" in it. So, I did an informal poll on my blog, and Fragmented
			Media won out. This didn't last long, simply because the "Media" attatchment was much too
			restrictive, and didn't really reflect what we could do. So, in late 2003 the name was
			changed one final time to Fragmented Development, and the domain was registered in early
			2004.
		</p>
		<p>
			After a couple reorganizations and different groupings, <strong>Fragmented
			Development</strong> has become my personal website, where I host a small basketfull of
			Free software applications.

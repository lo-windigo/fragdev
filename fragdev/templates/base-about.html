TEXT TO IMPLEMENT: My primary career was managing the web infrastructure for a medium-sized local government on limited resources. This experience ingrained the principles of efficiency and scalability, and gave me a great respect for well structured code and markup. We were forced to make due with aging hardware while meeting increasing demands from both the public and internal departments, which created some extremely interesting challenges!

Through my freelancing and personal/open source projects, I've had additional experience with many different platforms, languages, and development methodologies. I'm very well-versed in source control (primarily git) and working remotely with team members. On every project, both at Warren County and other projects, I've become accustomed to working with many different people with different interest and goals. I've been able to balance the needs of many different parties and keep everyone satisfied while projects are completed in an order that makes the most sense for everyone involved.

				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p>
					I earned my degree in networking at <a href="http://sunyacc.edu">SUNY
					Adirondack</a> in 2006. The networking program gave me a deep
					understanding of how the web and HTTP works at the network level, and
					introduced me to programming and PHP.

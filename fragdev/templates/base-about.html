			<h1>About Jake</h1>
			<p>
				Hi - I'm a {{ age }}-year-old guy (refresh the page-
				that number should be updated every second) living in Glens Falls, New York.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm currently working full time at <a href="http://warrencountyny.gov">Warren County, NY</a>,
				and working on migrating to California.
			</p>
			<p>
				I dig coffee, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free software</a>,

			<h2>History of Fragmented Development</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Fragmented Development</strong> was originally started as a Web Design company,
				going by the name of Wednesday Bubbles. While mildly successful in it's
				own small way, WB had several problems; first, the general public cannot
				spell Wednesday. Also, it's very hard to gain respect with a name that
				includes the word "Bubbles" in it. So, I did an informal poll on my blog, and Fragmented
				Media won out. This didn't last long, simply because the "Media" attatchment was much too
				restrictive, and didn't really reflect what we could do. So, in late 2003 the name was
				changed one final time to Fragmented Development, and the domain was registered in early
				2004.
			</p>
			<p>
				After a couple reorganizations and different groupings, <strong>Fragmented
				Development</strong> has become my personal web site, where I host a small basketfull of
				Free software applications.
